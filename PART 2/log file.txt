These are the changes I made for the part 2:

1: I improve weekly display for all the semester. so based on semester weeks Iam displaying based on the module they chose.

2: I remove the combo box, which it resolve the error, so Include the select combo box module and date and capture hours to update 
the self study hours in a week

3: I also include the option to go to the display class

4: Include the .NET framework for both projects which are 'WPF and DLL' and I also update the readme file based on part 2
.
